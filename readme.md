In this basic Counter project of React, I got to learn:
- What are hooks and why they are used in React.
- And again the flow of the project.
- Implemented following condition:
-- If count is more then 20. Then show alert message "Limit Exceeded !!"
-- If Count is setting negative value. Then show alert message "Negative value not allowed !!"
